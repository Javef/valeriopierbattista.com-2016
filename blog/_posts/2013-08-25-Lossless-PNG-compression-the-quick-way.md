Portable Network Graphics (PNG) is a raster graphics file format that supports lossless data compression. PNG was created as an improved, non-patented replacement for Graphics Interchange Format (GIF), and is the most used lossless image compression format on the World Wide Web.

One bad news about Photoshop exported PNG files is the file size: png files are quite "heavy" and in a world of bandwidth optimization having a 300k png image is not an option.

One service I particularly like is <a href="http://tinypng.org/" target="_blank">TinyPNG.org</a> because it's quick, it's free and it works like a charm. What this website (and many others) does is losslessly compress your photoshop PNG exported files. As you can see from the picture below, you can't see any difference from the original.

What "Panda" does is to remove unnecessary bytes from image files. It is a "lossless" tool, which means it optimizes the images without changing their look or visual quality.

Of course this is one <em>extra</em> step to add to your website development workflow, but optimizing images is one of the most important things to consider when it comes to bandwidth optimization and website loadspeed.

This is an online tool, and yeah well, it's not optimal. Some softwares have image optimization engines running, packed with a whole lot of other features. I'm talking about <a href="http://incident57.com/codekit/index.php" target="_blank">CodeKit</a> for Mac and <a href="http://alphapixels.com/prepros/" target="_blank">Prepros</a> for Windows. Stay tuned for more ...
